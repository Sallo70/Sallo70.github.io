2. **ChatGPT**: To resize an image in HTML, you can use the 'width' and 'height' attributes of the 'img' tag. Here's an example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" width="300" height="200">
```

In this example, the 'width' attribute is set to 300 pixels and the 'height' attribute is set to 200 pixels. You can adjust these values according to your desired dimensions.

It's important to note that specifying the dimensions directly like this can distort the image's aspect ratio. If you want to maintain the aspect ratio while resizing, you can specify either the width or the height and leave the other attribute blank. For example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" width="300">
```

In this case, the image will be resized to a width of 300 pixels while maintaining its original aspect ratio. The height will be adjusted automatically.

Alternatively, you can use CSS to control the image's size. Here's an example using CSS:

```html
<style>
    .image {
        width: 300px;
        height: auto;
    }
</style>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="image">
```

In this example, the image is given a class of "image" and the CSS rule sets the width to 300 pixels and the height to 'auto', which maintains the aspect ratio.

Using CSS provides more flexibility and control over the image size, so it is often the preferred approach.
